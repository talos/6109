The mission of [GovLab](http://thegovlab.org) is to improve people's lives by improving the way we make decisions.

To fulfill this mission, the product & engineering team (that's Arnaud, John and Luis for now) works along three axes:
* Internal tools for us (but also others to use) with a focus on knowledge management, online education and data science & visualization.
* Foundation tools to empower civic innovators with their work, for example an annotation framework, data gathering, expert network tools.
* Special one-off projects that are related to governance and technology, including testifying about open data policy, providing search mechanisms for the deep Internet of government documents, and more.

As our name suggests, we are in the business of experimentation.
* The digital artifacts we build will be **free and open source**. We believe in open code.
* The digital artifacts we build we be **optimized for change**. We believe what we produce should be easy to use and modify.

We don't expect perfection the first time. We will be transparent, releasing early and often.

What should you expect on this blog?
* Tales about our product and engineering adventures.
* Info about technologies we have been playing with.
* Pointers to cool articles and papers.
