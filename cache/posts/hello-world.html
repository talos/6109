<p>The mission of <a href="http://thegovlab.org">GovLab</a> is to improve people's lives by improving the way we make decisions.</p>
<p>To fulfill this mission, the product &amp; engineering team (that's <a href="https://github.com/sahuguet">Arnaud</a>, <a href="https://github.com/talos">John</a> and <a href="https://github.com/luisdaniel">Luis</a> for now) works along three axes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Internal tools for us (but also others to use) with a focus on knowledge management, online education and data science &amp; visualization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foundation tools to empower civic innovators with their work, for example an annotation framework, data gathering, expert network tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Special one-off projects that are related to governance and technology, including testifying about open data policy, providing search mechanisms for the deep Internet of government documents, and more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As our name suggests, we are in the business of experimentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The digital artifacts we build will be <strong>free and open source</strong>. We believe in open code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The digital artifacts we build we be <strong>optimized for change</strong>. We believe what we produce should be easy to use and modify.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We don't expect perfection the first time. We will be transparent, releasing early and often.</p>
